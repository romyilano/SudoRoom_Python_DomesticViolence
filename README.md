![SudoRoom Late Afternoons](graphics/bannerSlice.png)

# Overview
This is a basic tutorial on python using the command line.
Held at [SudoRoom](https://sudoroom.org) late afternoons / Spring 2016. 

* [Session 1 - Setup and Intro](sessions/session01.md)
* [Session 2 - Classes, functions](session/session02.md)

## Level

Python newbie teaching other python newbies. 

Note: I am _not_ a teacher! This is an independent workshop, _not_ a class and _not_ a bootcamp.  =D I'm a creator just like you. 

This is very self-guided, dependent on you taking initiative, from the perspective of people who eventually want to learn in order to build things. The focus is on you learning how to ask the right questions.

## Benefits

* You will get more comfortable using the command line, which opens many opportunities to learn other useful things in coding
* You can make a basic "networked" app
* You can avoid doing clerical gruntwork and using horrible Excel Macros

This was originally created for Women Who Code East Bay but this session is open to all genders! Trans, male, female... 

_Women dominate clerical, lower-paid clerical jobs like entry level accounting and secretarial work or lower-level marketing positions. They live their lives in Excel sheets. Enabling them to learn basic coding and taking advantage of their intelligence and potential will help make the world a better place._
